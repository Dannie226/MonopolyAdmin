# Licensing Info

## Models:
### Info:
The monopoly board model is where all the tokens, and board came from. The Dice included in this gltf were not accurate to how real dice are made.
Because of this, I am using a secondary dice model that is accurate (opposite sides add up to 7).  
The downloaded models were a GLTF, and I bundled them into a GLB.
Table model was found from [polyhaven models](https://polyhaven.com/models)

## Other Images:
### Info:
The other images are of the tokens, rendered in three.js. I don't know whether that means the images should be under the same license as the token models as that is what the images are of.  
I would rather be safe than sorry (Copyright lawsuits are no joke), so image information is below
